[Formation of massive disk galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09722)

**Data**: Massive Disk Galaxies (B/T < 0.3) from ``IllustrisTNG100-1``.

**Main Conclusion**: 

1. Three types of morphology evolution of massive disk galaixes (Fig. 4).
2. Strong dependence of remnant morphology on the orbit type of major mergers (Fig. 6).



[The nuclear environment of NGC 2442: a Compton-thick low-luminosity AGN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09420)

Case Study

**Data**: GMOS, Chandra data, XMM–Newton and NuSTAR spectra, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images.

**Main Conclusion**: 

1. There is a Compton-thick low-luminosity AGN (LINERs) in NGC 2442 nucleus (Table. 1 & Fig. 5).
2. The presence of mostly old stellar populations (∼ 10 Gyr), with high metallicity (z = 0.02 and 0.05), and an absence of recent star formation, which might be a consequence of the AGN feedback, associated with the observed outflow. (Fig. 10-12).
3. Central region of NGC 2442 shows many differences relative to the MW,  such as the presence of an AGN and the absence of young stellar populations (Wolf–Rayet stars).
