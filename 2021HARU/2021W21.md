## [Chemical abundances in the nuclear region of nearby galaxies from the Palomar Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11164)
**Samples**:  SF Galaxies (87) + Seyferts 2 (16) + LINERs (40) from the Palomar.  
Spectroscopic Survey (Table. 5).
**Main Conclusions**:   
1. Seyferts 2 present slightly higher chemical abundances but this result must be reexamined in larger samples of Seyfert galaxies. Lower chemical abundances for LINERs than for SFG (Fig. 7-10).
2. Host galaxy properties of AGN  are not correlated with estimated chemical abundances (Appendix B).


## [Molecular line ratio diagnostics and gas kinematics in the AGN host Seyfert galaxy NGC 5033](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11198)
Case Study.  
**Main Conclusions**: 
1. ^{12}CO(1–0) is more extended over NGC 5033’s disc compared to the other CO lines (Fig. 3 & 5).   
2. The south of the gaseous disc contains cooler gas than the northern part, and the centre hosts warmer and less tenuous gas with a similar dense gas fraction compared to most galaxies of similar type.  


## [DIFFUSE SYNCHROTRON EMISSION ASSOCIATED WITH THE STARBURST IN THE CIRCUMNUCLEAR DISK OF NGC 1275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11073)
**VLBI detection of the diffuse synchrotron emission on a scale of several tens pc coinciding spatially with the molecular gas disk recently discovered by ALMA observations in NGC 1275.**  
**Notice**:  The synchrotron emissions are most likely resulted from the relativistic electrons produced by the supernova explosions (see more in Section 4.1-4.2 & Fig. 3).


## [The Bluedisk survey: thickness of Hi layers in gas rich spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10683)  
**Data**: galaxies from BLUEDISK HI survey + VIVA + THINGS.  
**Main Conclusions**:  
1. The HI scale height radial profiles can be divided into three categories.  
	1.1  HI disk thickness increases with radius.  
	1.2  HI disk thickness constant with radius.  
	1.3  Complex scale height radial profiles.  
2. The average HI scale height within the optical disk is correlated with the atomic gas fraction and the central HI velocity dispersion (Fig. 12-15).  
3. The relation between M_H2/M_HI and the HI scale height confirm the role of gas disk thickness on star formation efficiency.
