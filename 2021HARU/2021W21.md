## [The SAMI Galaxy Survey: The role of disc fading and progenitor bias in kinematic transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10179)  
**Background**: The local S0 has both higher photometric concentration and lower stellar spin than spiral galaxies of comparable mass.  
**Aim**: Constructing dynamically self–consistent galaxy models, with a bulge, disc and halo using the ```GalactICS``` (Taranu+2017) to model the SAMI data  (Section 2.1).  
Bulge: uniformly old stellar population. 
Disc: current star formation.  
**Main Conclusions**:  
1. Decline measured spin as the bulge contribution becomes more dominant (Fig. 3), and also leads to increased concentration (Fig. 5 & 6).
2. This is most significant for systems with B/T = 0.5 (Fig. 3-6, 10).  
3. The difference between main sequence and passive galaxies is too great to be due to disc fading alone (Fig. 11).

## [Are all post-starbursts mergers? HST reveals hidden disturbances in the majority of PSBs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09956)
**Data**: 26 gas-rich, **shocked** post-starburst galaxies with HST (Strong H-delta absorption; Emission lines within BPT shocked region; Emission line ratios outside of the star formation or composite region on at least one BPT diagram, Section 2.1).  
**Main Conclusion**:  
1. The 26 post-starbursts have intermediate morphologies between disk and bulge-dominated types, and have red bulges, likely due to dust obscuration in the cores. (Fig. 11 & 15).  
2. 88% of the samples have a higher residual flux fraction (with respect to the flux measured by Sereic profile) than star-forming and quiescent galaxies, and hence is more structurally disturbed (Fig. 15). These disturbances are most prominent in B and I-bands and not in H-band, and hence likely caused by a dust-obscured central structures (Fig. 12 - 13).   
3. ~27% galaxies are clear merger remnants (Fig. 6), we found that disturbances in another ~30% of the sample are internal, caused by small-scale perturbations or dust substructures rather than tidal features, and require high-resolution imaging to detect (Fig. 15).  
4. These disturbances fade over time (Fig. 14).

## [Chemical abundances in the nuclear region of nearby galaxies from the Palomar Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11164)
**Samples**:  SF Galaxies (87) + Seyferts 2 (16) + LINERs (40) from the Palomar Spectroscopic Survey (Table. 5).   
**Main Conclusions**:   
1. Seyferts 2 present slightly higher chemical abundances but this result must be reexamined in larger samples of Seyfert galaxies. Lower chemical abundances for LINERs than for SFG (Fig. 7-10).
2. Host galaxy properties of AGN  are not correlated with estimated chemical abundances (Appendix B).


## [Molecular line ratio diagnostics and gas kinematics in the AGN host Seyfert galaxy NGC 5033](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11198)
Case Study.  
**Main Conclusions**: 
1. ^{12}CO(1–0) is more extended over NGC 5033’s disc compared to the other CO lines (Fig. 3 & 5).   
2. The south of the gaseous disc contains cooler gas than the northern part, and the centre hosts warmer and less tenuous gas with a similar dense gas fraction compared to most galaxies of similar type.  


## [Diffuse Synchrotron Emission Associated with the Starburst in the Circumnuclear Disk of NGC 1275](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11073)
**VLBI detection of the diffuse synchrotron emission on a scale of several tens pc coinciding spatially with the molecular gas disk recently discovered by ALMA observations in NGC 1275.**  
**Notice**:  The synchrotron emissions are most likely resulted from the relativistic electrons produced by the supernova explosions (see more in Section 4.1-4.2 & Fig. 3).


## [The Bluedisk survey: thickness of Hi layers in gas rich spiral galaxies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.10683)  
**Data**: galaxies from BLUEDISK HI survey + VIVA + THINGS.  
**Main Conclusions**:  
1. The HI scale height radial profiles can be divided into three categories.  
	1.1  HI disk thickness increases with radius.  
	1.2  HI disk thickness constant with radius.  
	1.3  Complex scale height radial profiles.  
2. The average HI scale height within the optical disk is correlated with the atomic gas fraction and the central HI velocity dispersion (Fig. 12-15).  
3. The relation between M_H2/M_HI and the HI scale height confirm the role of gas disk thickness on star formation efficiency.

## [The origin of galaxy colour bimodality in the scatter of the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12145)  
**Background**:  
- Observation: At a given stellar mass, blue galaxies tend to live in haloes with lower mass while red galaxies live in more massive host haloes.  
- Theoretical Prediction: At the same halo mass, galaxies with high stellar masses tend to live in early-formed haloes (leads to an opposite trend).
- ```SIMBA``` Simulation: Reproduce the observation (Fig. 1).   

**Main Conclusions**:   
1. Galaxies that transition later have lower halo mass at a given M_stellar, early transition galaxies tend to live in late formed haloes. Haloes that assemble quickly tend to host bluer galaxies (Fig. 2).   
2. At a given final halo mass, early-formed haloes have higher cold gas fractions. In late-formed haloes with low cold gas fractions, the galaxy transitions earlier, thus setting up an anti-correlation of the halo assembly time and galaxy transition time (Fig. 4).
3. The physics driving this in SIMBA is primarily jet-mode AGN feedback, which kicks in at low Eddington ratios that occur when cold gas fractions are low, and quenches the galaxy (Fig. 5).
4. The X-ray AGN feedback model in SIMBA, which kicks in for jet-mode galaxy with a low gas fraction, removes any residual star formation and thus keeps the galaxy in quiet, leading to red colour (Fig. 6).
