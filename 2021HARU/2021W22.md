## [Jet-induced feedback in the [O III] lines of early evolution stage active galactic nuclei](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.01076)

**Background**:  
1. Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1s) are ideal laboratories to study the early phases of AGN feedback, they are characterized by fast growing black holes with high Eddington ratios, and also by high metallicity, especially prominent Fe II multiplets.  
2. NLS1s are mostly non-jetted sources, but some of them do actually harbor powerful relativistic jets.  
Data:  74 NLS1s observed with the JVLA at 5 GHz in its most extended A configuration (longest baseline 36 km, resolution 0.5”).   

**Main Conclusions**:  
1. The presence of relativistic jets in these AGN can produce a bulk outflowing motion in the NLR, causing the [O III] lines to appear blue-shifted with respect to their restframe wavelength (Fig. 3 & 4).  
2. [O III] shifts may be a good proxy to identify the presence of relativistic jets.

## [A 3.5 Mpc-long radio relic in the galaxy cluster ClG 0217+70](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.00679)

Case Study.  
Data: LOFAR 141 MHz + VLA 1.4/1.5 GHz  
1. The presence of a giant radio halo in the cluster centre and multiple relics in the outskirts. The non-thermal radio and thermal X-ray emission in the halo region where the radio and X-ray emission is detected above 2σ are positively correlated (Fig. 4 & Table. 3).  
2.  Using the spectral index at the outer edge of the relics, the relics are found to be generated by low Mach number shocks that are likely unable to directly accelerate thermal electrons to create the observed surface brightness in the relics (Fig. 13).
