## [JWST NIRCam Observations of SN 1987A: Spitzer Comparison and Spectral Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13011.pdf)
**Background**: A type II SN in the LMC. The emission arises from the circumstellar equatorial ring (ER).  
**Data**:  
Spitzer IRAC: 3.6 & 4.5 µm (2004 - 2019), These bands are very similar to the F356W and F444W bands of JWST NIRCam
JWST NIRCam:  Figure 2 & 3.  
Composite Comparison: Figure 4.  
**Conclusions**:  
NIRCam observations clearly reveal that much of this emission is from a newly developing outer portion of the ER (Figure 5, 11, and 12).  
The bulk of the emission in the field can be represented by 5 standard spectral energy distributions (SEDs), each with a distinct origin and spatial distribution.  
This spectral decomposition provides a powerful technique for distinguishing overlapping emission from the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the supernova (SN) ejecta, excited by the forward and reverse shocks respectively.  


## [PEARLS: JWST counterparts of micro-Jy radio sources in the Time Domain Field](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13008.pdf)
**PEARLS**: 
Prime Extragalactic Areas for Reionization and Lensing Science; ∼50 minute exposure times.  
4.4 µm counterparts for 62 of 63 3 GHz sources with S(3 GHz) > 5 µJy (Figure 1 & 2), but finding the correct counterpart for a given
source might be tricky.  
The only unidentified radio source may be a lobe of a nearby Seyfert galaxy, or it may be an infraredfaint radio source.
