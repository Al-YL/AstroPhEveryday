## [Simulated host galaxy analogs of high-z quasars observed with JWST](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08914.pdf)

**Targets**: two low-luminosity high-z quasars, J2255+0251 and J2236+0032, detected by JWSTâ€™s NIRCam.

**Aim**: examine the implications of the measured properties of J2255+0251 and J2236+0032 within the context of the hydrodynamic simulation BlueTides at z = 6.5.

**Main Conclusion**:
